## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like that shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:cars). The table also shows the functionality of one of the helper functions of knitr [@R-knitr].

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption="Statistical summary of the data in the built-in data frame cars.")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

(ref:pressure) Plot of vapor pressure (open circles) as a function of temperature for mercury. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:pressure)'}
plot(pressure, xlab=expression(paste("Temperature (",degree*C,
                                     ")")),
     ylab="Pressure (mm Hg)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk producing Figure \@ref(fig:pressure) to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot [@R-base].

## Equations

RMarkdown can also include equations. These are entered using LaTeX format.

\begin{equation}
  [P]_{bound}=\frac{[P]_{total}[L]^n}{[L]^n+[L]_{0.5}^n}
  (\#eq:hill)
\end{equation}

If the equation is appropriately labeled, the equation will be numbered. References to the equations, like to Equation \@ref(eq:hill), should also work.

## References

```{r}
knitr::write_bib(c("base", "knitr"), "knitr.bib")
```
