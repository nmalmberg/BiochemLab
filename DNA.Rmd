```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

(ref:abstract) Replace this sentence with your abstract.

You will need to install one (or two) additional package(s) in order to analyze
your sequencing data (at least to make it easier to read and represent). The
following code block only needs to be run once.

```{r installation, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("Biostrings", quietly = TRUE))
  BiocManager::install(c("Biostrings","pwalign"))
```

This lab report will require an introduction that has at least two citations
of the primary literature, so be sure to add those to the references.bib file.
You will presumably be using a protocol for isolating your DNA that also needs
to be cited, so be sure to add those to the file, as well.

The following code block will help you keep track of your PCR samples. This way,
you can put a number on each tube, and keep track of the various information
associated with each sample. Student name should not have any spaces (last name
is probably sufficient). For the primer, use the NCBI identifier for the SNP
amplified by the primer set. Refer to the gel either by letter or number, and
refer to the lane by number. The OMRF label should be distinct, and should
include the string "OBU", but shouldn't include nonalphanumeric characters.
For the samples you don't send to OMRF, put NA in for the OMRF column.

```{r pcr}
pcrdata <- read.table(header = TRUE, stringsAsFactors = TRUE, text = "
Tube    Student    Primer    Gel    Lane    OMRF")
```

If you measure the migration of bands on your gel using the imaging software, the
code block below can help you calculate the number of bases in the PCR products.

```{r mwdet}
csvlines <- readLines("GelFile.csv")
# We need to select the lines between "Bands:" and "Concentration:"
bands <- grep("Bands:", csvlines, fixed=TRUE, value=FALSE) + 2
conc <- grep("^Concentration:", csvlines, fixed=FALSE,
             value=FALSE) - 3
geldata <- read.delim(header=TRUE, row.names = 2,
                      text=paste(csvlines[bands:conc],
                                 collapse="\n"))
# Replace the MW column with NA for most of the bands, and with
# the appropriate MW for the ladder bands.
geldata$MW <- NA
geldata["A3", "MW"] <- 170 # Etc.

# Fit the data to a straight line, with a logarithmic scaling
# of the MW data.
mwmodel <- glm(MW~Rf, data=geldata, family=gaussian(link=log))

# Use the model to predict the molecular weights of the bands
# from other lanes. Include standard errors of the weights.
predict(mwmodel, newdata=subset(geldata, Lane.ID!="A"),
        type="response", se.fit=TRUE)
```

You can use the code block below to include an image of a gel, if it would
be helpful. If you use more than one gel picture, you'll need to change the
filename into a vector of filenames.

```{r gelimage, fig.cap='(ref:gelimage)', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("GelImage.JPG",dpi=NA)
```

(ref:gelimage) Make sure you describe the contents of each lane in this figure caption, assuming you are planning to include the figure.

The code block below should generate a figure with the sequences returned from OMRF
aligned to the sequences we should have got from amplification with those primers.
You'll probably still have to work to figure out which base is the SNP, but this
should make it easier once you know what you're looking for.

```{r alignment, fig.cap="(ref:alignment)"}
# Select PCR tubes that were sent to OMRF
omrf <- subset(pcrdata, !is.na(OMRF))
# Remove primers, etc. that weren't sent to OMRF
droplevels(omrf) -> omrf
# Go through each primer, and read in files corresponding to the
# reference sequence and to the files returned from OMRF
for (primer in levels(omrf$Primer)){
  referencefile <- paste0("sequences/", primer, ".fasta")
  if (file.exists(referencefile)){
    # Select all filenames corresponding to samples sent to OMRF
    # corresponding to this primer.
    fileexp <- paste0("(", omrf$OMRF[omrf$Primer==primer],")", collapse = "|")
    # It's probably simplest if the sequences are in a folder called sequences
    sequencefiles <- list.files("sequences", pattern = fileexp, ignore.case = TRUE,
                                full.names = TRUE)
    sequences <- character(length=length(sequencefiles))
    names(sequences) <- basename(sequencefiles)
    for (sequencefile in sequencefiles){
      sequences[basename(sequencefile)] <- paste0(readLines(sequencefile),
                                                  collapse = "")
    }
    # Use Biostrings function to read FASTA.
    referenceseq <- Biostrings::readDNAStringSet(referencefile)
    align <- pwalign::pairwiseAlignment(pattern=sequences, subject=referenceseq)
    pwalign::writePairwiseAlignments(align)
  }
}
```

(ref:alignment) Your caption describing the alignments should go here.

As always, don't forget to cite your sources as appropriate.
Almost certainly your sources should include articles that discuss the
genome-wide association studies that have identified these SNPs as significant
for caffeine/coffee consumption. You can look up the studies by SNP at the
[Genome-wide Association Studies Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/)
