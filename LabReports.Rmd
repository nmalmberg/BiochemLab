(ref:abstract) Lab reports typically require a significant amount of data analysis that must be presented in a highly structured form. RMarkdown allows the combining of data analysis and writeup into a single document. The present work outlines the process of creating a lab report using RMarkdown. Formatting considerations and data analysis are considered.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like that shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:cars). The table also shows the functionality of one of the helper functions of knitr [@R-knitr].

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption="Statistical summary of the data in the built-in data frame cars.")
```

Sometimes you may need to include some modified fonts, to discuss topics like the &pi;-electrons of C~6~H~6~.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

(ref:pressure) Plot of vapor pressure (open circles) as a function of temperature for mercury. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:pressure)'}
plot(pressure, xlab=expression(paste("Temperature (",degree*C,
                                     ")")),
     ylab="Pressure (mm Hg)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter [@gagnon_fluorine-tagged_2010] was added to the code chunk producing Figure \@ref(fig:pressure) to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot [@R-base].

If you have an image to include, rather than a plot to create from data, there are Markdown commands to include images.

![(ref:acids)](adnly.png)

(ref:acids) Five amino acids with very different solubilities in water. From left, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, leucine, tyrosine.

It might take advantage of more of the features of knitr, though, to use another of the knitr helper functions in an R code block.
```{r acids, fig.cap='(ref:acids)'}
knitr::include_graphics('adnly.png', dpi=NA)
```


## Equations

RMarkdown can also include equations. These are entered using LaTeX format.

\begin{equation}
  [P]_{bound}=\frac{[P]_{total}[L]^n}{[L]^n+[L]_{0.5}^n}
  (\#eq:hill)
\end{equation}

If the equation is appropriately labeled, the equation will be numbered. References to the equations, like to Equation \@ref(eq:hill), should also work.

## References

Lab reports must contain an appropriate list of references. These are typically
the sources that have been cited during the course of writing the report,
including articles that contribute to the significance of the work, sources
like your lab book [@boyer_modern_2000] for the methods, and any software you
used in the data analysis [@R-base]. To incorporate these references in an
RMarkdown document, these references should be listed in a BibTeX file in the
same folder as your document.

This document contains utilizes two BibTeX files, listed in the header at the top
of the file. One is a file that already exists in this project, called
references.bib, that contains several sources to cite, most of which you will
*not* cite in the experiments outlined in this project, but can help you to see
how BibTeX sources are listed in the file, if you need to create more entries
by hand. Most of the entries in this file were created with [Zotero](http://zotero.org), which can also be used to create additional entries
for inclusion in this file. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) can also
be used to create entries for inclusion in this file.

The other file listed in the header is created at the time of knitting the file.
This file is created by the code block below, and contains entries for all the
R packages listed in the first part of the function. The code block extracts the
citation information from the packages that are installed in the current
environment.

```{r}
knitr::write_bib(c("base", "knitr"), "knitr.bib")
```

To cite the sources that are listed in these files, use square brackets containing
an at sign followed by the key for the entry to be cited [@lasker_protein_1999].
In the references.bib file, this is the first set of characters following the
curly brackets at the beginning of the entry. The entries in the knitr.bib file
will have keys that start with "R-" and end with the name of the package [@R-knitr].

When the file is knit, the reference information will be extracted from the
BibTeX files, and both citations and references will be formatted according to
the Citation Style Language (CSL) file listed in the header. The code block
below will make sure that this file can be found in your current folder,
downloading the file from Zotero's website if necessary. The references will
be placed at the end of the document.

```{bash}
if [! -s american-chemical-society.csl]; then
  curl http://zotero.org/styles/american-chemical-society.csl;
fi
```
