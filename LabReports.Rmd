(ref:abstract) Lab reports typically require a significant amount of data analysis that must be presented in a highly structured form. RMarkdown allows the combining of data analysis and writeup into a single document. The present work outlines the process of creating a lab report using RMarkdown. Formatting considerations and data analysis are considered.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. This document will contain a few of the salient features for using R Markdown for producing lab reports.

One of the advantages of using R Markdown for writing lab reports is that the
data analysis for the lab can be included in the document. These will almost
always be located in *code chunks* located in the document. These chunks, which
are marked by triple backticks at the beginning of a line, can be used to
perform calculations or to output content in the lab report. Most of these
code chunks will be written for you, although there may be times when you have
to make modifications to these chunks. Where these modifications need to be
made should be fairly clear, but if you have questions, *ask*.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. The code that created the output will be shown in a gray box above the output, like the chunk that creates Table\ \@ref(tab:cars). This information is important to your instructor for the purposes of confirming that you have performed the analysis correctly. However, because this level of analysis is not normally incorporated into a scientific paper, you should write your report *as if the code wasn't there*.

```{r cars}
knitr::kable(summary(cars), caption="Statistical summary of the data in the built-in data frame cars.")
```

It is also possible to include R code within a paragraph of text. This is
accomplished by surrounding a single line of code with single backticks. This
could be useful to report that the average of the speed values in the cars
data frame is `r mean(cars$speed)`.

### YAML Header

The lines at the top of the document specify the title of the document, the author,
and other information that is necessary to produce the final document. For your lab
reports, you should always change the title, author and date of the paper. You can
also specify an abstract in the YAML block (as with this paper), but if you use a
text reference (like this document does), you wouldn't need to change the YAML
itself.

### Headers

A title of a section should go on a line by itself, preceded by one or more
pound signs (#) and a space. The more signs in front of the title, the smaller
the title, which is appropriate for subsections.

### Font Modifications

Sometimes you may need to include some modified fonts, to discuss topics like the &pi;-electrons of C~6~H~6~.

### Specifying Data

Data will generally be specified in R code chunks, and will be assigned to a
*variable* name. This may include single numbers or *vectors*, which are
collections of values of the same type. This will often be convenient for
calculations, as we can perform the same calculation on all numbers of a vector
at once. We will also make use of *data frames*, which are collections of vectors
of the same length, with names assigned to the different vectors. There are
code chunks in some of these files for creating data frames, but occasionally
we will take advantage of the output of different instruments, which will
usually create data in the appropriate shape for making these 2-d data
arrangements.

## Figures and Tables

Plots of data will typically be generated with R code chunks, as seen in
Figure\ \@ref(fig:pressure). Remember that a figure needs to be able to stand
largely on its own, and thus must have an *informative* caption that specifies
what is plotted on the graph with regard to both symbols and lines, to indicate
the source both of the data and any analysis that is present in the plot [@R-base].

(ref:pressure) Plot of vapor pressure (open circles) as a function of temperature for mercury. 

```{r pressure, fig.cap='(ref:pressure)'}
plot(pressure, xlab=expression(paste("Temperature (",degree*C,
                                     ")")),
     ylab="Pressure (mm Hg)")
```

For those figures that derive from images created with an external program,
it's probably best to include these images with the *include_graphics* function
of the *knitr* package [@R-knitr], as shown in Figure\ \@ref(fig:acids).
Remember that these images also need an informative caption to allow the figure
to stand on its own. Often, these images would also benefit from additional
annotation, to make clear what is present in each part of the image.

(ref:acids) Five amino acids with very different solubilities in water. From left, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, leucine, tyrosine.

```{r acids, fig.cap='(ref:acids)'}
knitr::include_graphics('adnly.png', dpi=NA)
```

Tables, like that shown in Table\ \@ref(tab:cars), are most easily created
using the *kable* function of *knitr* [@R-knitr]. This will work well mainly
if the data to be shown in the table is arranged in a data frame. Markdown
has other techniques for creating tables if desired.

### Bookdown

We will be using a package called *bookdown* [@R-bookdown] to create the final
versions of the lab reports we create. One of the advantages of using bookdown
is that code blocks that have captions will automatically be labeled with
"Figure" or "Table" and the number of the float prepended to the caption.
Bookdown also allows references to these figures and tables that are based
on the labels of the code chunks that create them. Bookdown also extends Markdown
with *text references*, which can be used to substitute a placeholder with a
longer portion of text anywhere text is appropriate. The placeholder takes the
form (ref:label), where *label* can be substituted with any word. The reference
itself is placed in a paragraph by itself, with the placeholder followed by a
single line of text. This text can contain any font modifications or
cross-references available in R Markdown.

## Equations

RMarkdown can also include equations. These are entered using LaTeX format.

\begin{equation}
  [P]_{bound}=\frac{[P]_{total}[L]^n}{[L]^n+[L]_{0.5}^n}
  (\#eq:hill)
\end{equation}

If the equation is appropriately labeled, bookdown will number the equation
as appropriate to a scientific work. References to the equations, like to Equation\ \@ref(eq:hill), should also work.

## References

Lab reports must contain an appropriate list of references. These are typically
the sources that have been cited during the course of writing the report,
including articles that contribute to the significance of the work, sources
like your lab book [@boyer_modern_2000] for the methods, and any software you
used in the data analysis [@R-base]. To incorporate these references in an
RMarkdown document, these references should be listed in a BibTeX file in the
same folder as your document.

This document contains utilizes two BibTeX files, listed in the header at the top
of the file. One is a file that already exists in this project, called
references.bib, that contains several sources to cite, most of which you will
*not* cite in the experiments outlined in this project, but can help you to see
how BibTeX sources are listed in the file, if you need to create more entries
by hand. Most of the entries in this file were created with [Zotero](http://zotero.org), which can also be used to create additional entries
for inclusion in this file. [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com) can also
be used to create entries for inclusion in this file.

The other file listed in the header is created at the time of knitting the file.
This file is created by the code block below, and contains entries for all the
R packages listed in the first part of the function. The code block extracts the
citation information from the packages that are installed in the current
environment.

```{r}
knitr::write_bib(c("base", "knitr", "bookdown"), "knitr.bib")
```

To cite the sources that are listed in these files, use square brackets containing
an at sign followed by the key for the entry to be cited [@lasker_protein_1999].
In the references.bib file, this is the first set of characters following the
curly brackets at the beginning of the entry. The entries in the knitr.bib file
will have keys that start with "R-" and end with the name of the package [@R-knitr].

When the file is knit, the reference information will be extracted from the
BibTeX files, and both citations and references will be formatted according to
the Citation Style Language (CSL) file listed in the header. The code block
below will make sure that this file can be found in your current folder,
downloading the file from Zotero's website if necessary. The references will
be placed at the end of the document.

```{bash}
if [! -s american-chemical-society.csl]; then
  curl http://zotero.org/styles/american-chemical-society.csl;
fi
```
